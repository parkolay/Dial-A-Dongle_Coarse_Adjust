Dial-A-Dongle
Simple device used for selecting a hex value and setting PORT D to the digital equivalent 
There were some issues with analog jitter.  Filters were added to the top (1000) and bottom (50) for deadband.
Several lsb were dropped and it didn't help, various delays and simple averaging filters were attempted (didn't help).
a 3.3V LDO was not attempted but might have helped.
the ResponsiveAnalogRead library was added and causes less issues than other things that were attempted.
But again, it is not without it's own problems.
I am really starting to think this should be using a rotary encoder...
Rotary encoder is better, the signal does not wonder but response is much slower.  
Spinning encoder shaft to fast will cause eronious results
